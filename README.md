MHacks
======

This project was [our submission](http://challengepost.com/software/typeonetwo)
to [MHacks IV](http://mhacks-iv.challengepost.com/), a hackathon where
1000 students met to create amazing things, transform dreams into
realities, and build their future.

During 36 hours straight of hacking, we created an entire platform consisting
of a pure-[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) iOS app,
pure-[Go](http://golang.org/) backend, and the beginnings of an Android app,
with a little help from [Facebook Parse](https://parse.com) and
[Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/).

We're really proud of what we created at our first hackathonâ€”especially since **we made the top ten!**

TypeOneTwo
==========

With a Type I diabetic on our team, we know first-hand what the lifestyle of a diabetic can be like. We recognize that there is a never-ending need for health tools and technology, especially those pertaining to diabetics. We believe that we can play a meaningful role in creating this future.

Being on the forefront of health requires cutting-edge tools, and we're very proud to have been able to integrate many powerful and new technologies:

* A pure-Swift iOS 8 app integrated with the unreleased HealthKit framework
* A server powered by in Go, easily convertible to be a Google App Engine app if needed
* Cross-platform RESTful services that our apps can readily consume
* Integration with Facebook's Parse framework to maintain users and data
* A beta version of an Android App

And above all, we had a blast doing it.
